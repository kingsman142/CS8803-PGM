\textbf{Problem 1}

Yes. Since all data was drawn from a distribution parameterized by $\theta^0$, and we are measuring the likelihood of the data given those parameters (i.e. maximum likelihood), then since the loss is the log-likelihood of the data, the data will  be most likely at the parameters $\theta^0$ which parameterize the distributions. As such, $\theta^0$ will be an optimum.
